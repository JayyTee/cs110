          I threw a wish in the well
          Don't ask me I'll never tell
          I looked to you as it fell
          And now you're in my way
          I'd trade my soul for a wish
          Pennies and dimes for a kiss
          I wasn't looking for this
          But now you're in my way
          Your stare was holding
          Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
          Hot night, wind was blowin'
          Where you think you're going baby?
          Hey, I just met you and this is crazy
          But here's my number, so call me maybe
          It's hard to look right at you baby
          But here's my number, so call me maybe
          Hey I just met you and this is crazy
          But here's my number, so call me maybe
          And all the other boys try to chase me
          But here's my number, so call me maybe
          You took your time with the call
          I took no time with the fall
          You gave me nothing at all
          But still you're in my way
          I begâ€¦
